# An installation of alasio 8.0.0 upgraded to this release, with what the release needs done
# by hand around its upgrade: what the box's cut-over runs, and what the end-to-end run's
# upgrade shard proves, on an installation of 8.0.0 it put data in (test/e2e/alasio.test.ts).
# Run as root on the host, kubectl reaching the cluster (KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
# for k3s on this machine). Everything is recorded in OUT, which is to be on a disk that
# outlives a restart of the machine, as /tmp may not.
#
#   UPGRADE=<command> UPGRADE_CHECK=<command> OUT=<dir> [FAIL_AT=<point>] upgrades/from-8.0.0.sh
#
# UPGRADE runs the release's upgrade as the configuration's owner, which restarts alasio,
# ending the turn it runs; UPGRADE_CHECK proves, before the upgrade, that it can, and that the
# release accepts the installation as it is. On a machine whose node is on the owner's PATH
# alone, as sudo's secure_path drops it:
#
#   as='sudo -u <owner> env HOME=/home/<owner> PATH=<node bin>:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin'
#   UPGRADE="$as npx --yes alasio@<v> upgrade --timeout 30m"
#   UPGRADE_CHECK="$as npx --yes alasio@<v> upgrade --check && sudo -u <owner> sudo -n true"
#
# the last proving that the owner's sudo asks for no password, which the upgrade does what it
# does as root through. FAIL_AT=before-the-point-of-no-return fails the run there, once every
# step before the upgrade has run; FAIL_AT=past-the-point-of-no-return past it, before the
# upgrade; and FAIL_AT=after-the-upgrade once the upgrade is through, before what follows it:
# as the upgrade shard rehearses a failure at each.
#
# It upgrades main alone, as alasio upgrade does, which refuses while a branch environment
# 8.0.0 made exists: it refuses then too, before it changes anything. Delete each first
# (alasio branch delete <name>), and make it again once upgraded.
#
# 8.0.0's log, its StatefulSet, has its claims labelled with 8.0.0's version, which this release's
# do not carry, and Kubernetes changes no StatefulSet's claim templates: an upgrade's apply of it
# is refused. So, before the point of no return, it deletes the log's StatefulSet, its pod and
# claim kept running, which the upgrade makes anew and takes back; a failure before the point
# of no return makes it again as 8.0.0 had it.
#
# The changes this release is made of add their steps to it, with what those steps need:
# before the point of no return, each with what makes again what it changed (restore), as a
# run that fails before it leaves the installation as it was; past it, before the upgrade;
# and once the upgrade is through, after it.
#
# Run again, it goes on from where it stopped: a failure before the point of no return makes
# again what the steps changed, and a run again starts over. Once past it
# (OUT/point-of-no-return), a run again goes on from there, and once the upgrade went through
# (OUT/upgraded), with what follows it alone.
