# An installation of alasio 10.0.9 upgraded to this release, with what the release needs done
# by hand around its upgrade: what the box's cut-over runs, and what the end-to-end run's
# upgrade shard proves, on an installation of 10.0.9 it put data in (test/e2e/alasio.test.ts).
# Run as root on the host, kubectl reaching the cluster (KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
# for k3s on this machine). Everything is recorded in OUT, which is to be on a disk that
# outlives a restart of the machine, as /tmp may not.
#
#   UPGRADE=<command> UPGRADE_CHECK=<command> CONFIG=<file> OUT=<dir> [FAIL_AT=<point>] upgrades/from-10.0.9.sh
#
# CONFIG is the configuration's file, the owner's alasio/config.json, which UPGRADE upgrades
# by and the steps below read, and change where they say.
#
# UPGRADE runs the release's upgrade as the configuration's owner, which replaces alasio,
# ending the turn it runs, with this release's: started at its count where that is fixed, or,
# where KEDA scales it, once an update, event or bound harness wakes it. UPGRADE_CHECK proves,
# before the upgrade, that it can, and that the release accepts the installation as it is. On
# a machine whose node is on the owner's PATH alone, as sudo's secure_path drops it:
#
#   as='sudo -u <owner> env HOME=/home/<owner> PATH=<node bin>:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin'
#   UPGRADE="$as npx --yes alasio@<v> upgrade --timeout 30m"
#   UPGRADE_CHECK="$as npx --yes alasio@<v> upgrade --check && sudo -u <owner> sudo -n true"
#
# the last proving that the owner's sudo asks for no password, which the upgrade does what it
# does as root through. FAIL_AT=before-the-point-of-no-return fails the run there, once every
# step before the upgrade has run; FAIL_AT=past-the-point-of-no-return past it, before the
# upgrade; and FAIL_AT=after-the-upgrade once the upgrade is through, before what follows it:
# as the upgrade shard rehearses a failure at each.
#
# It upgrades main alone, as alasio upgrade does, which refuses while a branch environment
# 10.0.9 made exists: it refuses then too, before it changes anything. Delete each first
# (alasio branch delete <name>), and make it again once upgraded.
#
# The changes this release is made of add their steps to it, with what those steps need:
# before the point of no return, past it, before the upgrade, and once the upgrade is
# through, after it. Each change's steps are a section of their own below, between its BEGIN
# and END lines, which the flow at the end of the script calls. None changes, before the
# point of no return, what a run that fails there would have to make again: a step that does
# brings what makes it again, for the flow to run as such a run ends.
#
# Run again, it goes on from where it stopped: a run that failed before the point of no
# return starts over. Once past it (OUT/point-of-no-return), a run again goes on from there,
# and once the upgrade went through (OUT/upgraded), with what follows it alone.

# BEGIN the sandbox gateway stopped.
#
# This release's node agents answer the sandbox gateway as 10.0.9's did not: a restore's prepare
# is given the manifest the gateway read, and its resume is asked as its pod is made, with the
# port its bayma serves on; and this release's gateway asks the agents of its own release alone
# (cli/src/manifests/sandbox-gateway.ts). The upgrade rolls the agents node by node beside the
# gateway, so 10.0.9's gateway, asking an agent rolled already, would have its restore's prepare
# refused, and forget the snapshot it restores. So, past the point of no return, before the
# upgrade, the gateway is stopped, its pods gone, so that no bind runs until the upgrade starts
# this release's, which asks none of 10.0.9's agents left: a turn that binds meanwhile fails to,
# as one does as the gateway rolls. Once, as OUT/gateway-stopped says it was: a run again after the
# upgrade failed finds the gateway the release's, or stopped still. Its pods' end is waited for
# STOP_WAIT_SECONDS (10 min) at most, looking every POLL_SECONDS (5).
